                <p>Javascript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use Javascript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated Javascript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

                <p>Javascript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to ECMAScript standard. It has a dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

                <p>You can do some amazing things with Javascript and paired with HTML and CSS the possibilities are endless of what you can accomplish designing a website.
